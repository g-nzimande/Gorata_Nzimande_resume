<!--**************************ABOUT ME SECTION*************************-->

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Gorata, I was born in Ramotswa, a village about 40km north east of Gaborone, Botswana. I grew in
        Gaborone until the age of 9 and then spent most of my life in Johannesburg, South Africa, where I currently
        reside.<br>
        <br>
        After high school I took a gap year to spend some time reflecting and deciding what it is I really wanted to do
        with my life going forward,I couldn't come to a solid decision so I got into the job market, working in various
        industries and gaining vast experience as I got older.
        I gained experience in junior roles and management roles where my duties ranged from
        customer service to project management.
        Two things that have been at the forefront of anything I do, are creativity and attention to detail.<br>
        <br>
        I'm very passionate about marrying creativity and innovation in the way that I think about problem solving.
        My exposure to different working environments, leadership styles, learning paths and a diversity of people,
        leads to me constantly want to innovate and improve processes.
        As of 2020 I'm embarking on a journey to become a better equipped and skilled programmer through online
        self-study and bootcamps.<br>
        <br>
        When I'm not in front of the computer, I'm exercising, learning more about reptiles, watching documentaries,
        immersed in DIY activities or just resting.<br>
